# [[Force]]s in [[Charge]]
## Force Between Two Charges
---
$$F=k\frac{q_1q_2}{r^2}$$
with charge $q_1$ and $q_2$ and distance $r$. $k$ is the [[Coulomb's Constant]]

## Force in [[Electric Fields]]
---
$$F_{electric}=q\vec{E}$$
Using the equation for [[Electric Fields Generated by Point Charge]], the following can be found
$$F_{electric}=\frac{qQ}{4\pi\epsilon_0r^2}$$
Which is equvilent to the above.
