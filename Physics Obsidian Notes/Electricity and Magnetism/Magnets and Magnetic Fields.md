# Magnets
---
- Magnets must come in polar pairs (no monopoles)
	- Cutting magnets makes more magnets
- Opposite attract, similar repel
## Domain Theory
- Hierarchy of Submagnetic Objects
- Levels
	- Domains (alignment of large chunks)
	- Crytals (Alignment of individual atoms) 
	- Atoms (Unpaired electrons in atoms)
- Explains ferromagnetic properties
# Magnet Field
---
- Strength of the magnetic force over space
## Flux
- Measured in Teslas $T$
## Magnetic Field Visualization
