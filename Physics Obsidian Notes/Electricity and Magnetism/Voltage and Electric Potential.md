# Electric Potential
---
- Voltage defined by [[Electrical Energy]] and [[Charge]]
- Describes [[Electric Fields]]
- Unit $\frac{J}{C}$
$$V=\frac Eq$$
where where $W$ is the **work done** by some force external to the field to bring a small test charge $q$ **from infinity to a particular point in an electric field.**
- By *this definition* **electric potential is zero at infinity**
## Electric Potential of a Point Charge in Space
$$V(r)=k\frac{Q}{r}$$
## Electric Potential of Point Charge in Electric Field of Another Point Charge
$$V=k\frac{qQ}{r}$$

## Potential Difference
- Generally, it is difficult to speak about potential from an *absolute perspective*
- Potential Difference measures the difference in potential between two points in an electric field
$$V_{a\rightarrow b}=V_b-V_a=\frac{W_{a\rightarrow b}}{q}$$
