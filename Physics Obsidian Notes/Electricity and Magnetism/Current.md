# Current
> Charge flowing in conductor
- Measured in **Amperes** with $I$
$$I=\frac{\Delta q}{\Delta t}$$
- Also defined as the amount of current to produce a force of $2\times10^{-17}N$ per meter
- Measures the flow of [[Charge]]
## Conventional Current

## Current from electron velocity
$$I = nAq\vec{v}$$
where a cylindrical cross section $A$ has $n$ electrons per unit volume, travelling at velocity $v$. $q$ is the charge of a single electron.
