## Kirchoff's Circuit Laws
---
- Helps determine [[Current]] and [[Voltage and Electric Potential]] in Circuits

### Current Law:
- the net current **entering and leaving a junction is 0**
$$\Sigma I = 0$$

### Voltage Law:
- In any closed loop in a circuit the net electric potential difference must be zero
$$\Sigma V = 0$$
- Here, the positive V sources are batteries in the same direction as the net current
- The negative V sources are batteries in the opposite direction, and resistors

## [[Resistance]] in Circuits
- When in series, resistors add

- When in parallel, the recipricals add

$$\frac{1}{R_{tot}} = \Sigma_r \frac 1r$$
