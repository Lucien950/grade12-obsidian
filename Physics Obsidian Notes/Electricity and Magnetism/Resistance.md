# Resistance
---
> The opposition of current
- Can be related to [[Voltage and Electric Potential]] and [[Current]] with the following
- Measured with unit $\Omega$ (ohms)
$$V=IR$$
## Resistivity of a Wire
- Units $\ohm m$, variable $\rho$
$$\rho=\frac{RA}{l}$$
where $A$ is the cross sectional area of a wire, $l$ is the length of the wire, and $R$ is the resistance of the wire.
### Temperature
$$\rho\propto T$$
As current increases, the temperature increases. To prevent exponential growth of heat, the wire's **resistance increases**.

## Non ohmic resistors
> Some resistors/metals don't have a relationship between voltage and current which is perfectly linear.

To parse this better, a V/R graph can be employed. **Ohmic resistors are flat**. **Non ohmic resistors vary**

## Variable Resistors
- Potentiometer can be used to vary the amount of resistance in a resistor
- Does this by varying the length of the resistive wire, thus the resistivity, thus the resistance

As long as no current leaves $W$, the following is true
