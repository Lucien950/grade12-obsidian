# Electron Volt
---
- Easier unit to work with when considering single charge particles
- Unit of Pure [[Electrical Energy]]
## Derivation
- Can be derived from [[Voltage and Electric Potential]] equation $W=qV$
- Work is energy, thus the energy of a single electron is the charge potential
$$W=1.60217662\times10^{-19}C \times 1V=1.602\times10^{-19}J=1eV$$
