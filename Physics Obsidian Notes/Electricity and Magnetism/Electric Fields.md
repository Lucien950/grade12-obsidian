# Electric Fields

> Describes the electric potential and movement of charge over space
## [[Force]] on electron in an Electric Field
$$F=q\vec{\epsilon_e}$$
Charge $q$ in electric field with magnitude $\vec{\epsilon_e}$
## Strength of an Electric Field of a point charge
$$\vec{\epsilon_e}(r)=\frac{kQ}{r^2}$$
Created by point charge $Q$
## Drawing Electric Fields
Direction of field lines:

Between two charges:

Between unequal charges, and parallel plates

## Hallow Conductors
- Charges are unbalanced on the surface
- All electric field lines go perpindicualrly into the sphere
- The inside of the sphere has no electric potentail whatsoever
- The sphere **MUST BE CONDUCTIVE**
