# Electric Cells
- Device which pushes [[Voltage and Electric Potential]]
## Electric Cell Capacity
- Measured in Amp hours ($I\Delta t=\Delta Q$)

<center>Discharge of a typical battery. Lower resistance is higher current, draining the battery faster</center>
$$\int V(t) dt=IR\Delta t=\Delta QR$$
Thus, the **amp-hour capacity running at a given resistance** can be found **from the area under the graph**.
## Cell Types
### Primary Cells
- Primary cell is single use
- Electrolytes and electron transfer
### Secondary Cells
- Secondary Cell can be recharged
## EMF and Internal Resistance
> Batteries have internal resistances. The voltage without resistance is the EMF of a battery

$$V_{out}=IR=ℰ-Ir$$
where $r$ is the internal resistance of the battery.
- Generally, $ℰ$ and $r$ are constant.
### Voltage variation with Internal resistance

- When current increases, the $V_{out}$ decreases
	- This is caused by the generally constant variables
