# Capacitors
---
- Quick storage of [[Charge]]
- Quick discharge
## Capacitance $C$
- Measured in Farads $F=\frac{A^2s^4}{kgm^2}$
$$C=\frac qV$$
## Construction
- Constructed of two [[Parallel Plates]]
- Goal is to maximize contact area, to store as much charge as possible

Due to parallel plates **???**
$$\frac qA=\epsilon_0\frac{V}{d}$$
rearranging for Capacitance
$$C=\epsilon_0\frac{A}{d}$$
where $A$ is area, and $d$ is the distance between the plates
## Capacitors and [[Electrical Energy]]

- Area under the graph is energy
- Area under the graph is triangle of square $qV$
$$E=\frac{qV}{2}=\frac{q^2}{2C}=\frac{CV^2}{2}$$
where $C$ is capacitance

## Capacitance in [[Circuits]]
### Parallel
$$C=C_1+C_2+C_3$$
### Series
$$C=\frac1{C_1}+\frac1{C_2}+\frac1{C_3}$$
## Charging and Discharging
