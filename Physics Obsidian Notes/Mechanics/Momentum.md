# Momentum $p$
---
- Calculated using Mass and [[Speed and Velocity]]
$$p=mv$$
## Use to find [[Force]]
---
$$F=ma$$
$$F=\frac{mv_{f}-mv_{0}}{\Delta t}$$
$$F_{net}=\frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t}$$
## Impulse $J$
---
> How much force for how much time?
$$J=\Delta p=F\Delta t$$
## Conservation
---
> Momentum same before and after **collision**
### Types of Collisions
- Elastic
	- Perfect conservation of momentum
	- One stops, one contines
- Inelastic
	- Less momentum due to energy deforming objects (heat)
	- Stick together after collision
- Explosive
	- More momentum after collision
	- Chemical energy expelled
	- Momentum still 0 as they are in opposite directions
