# Friction
---
> Type of [[Force]]
- Proportional to the Normal Force
$$F_{friction}=\mu F_{normal}$$
where $\mu$ is the coefficent of friction of the surfaces.

## Static Friction
> Friction maintaining 0 speed
- Use coefficient of static friction as coefficient
## Dynamic Friction
> Friction at non-zero speeds
- Use coefficient of dynamic friction as coefficient
