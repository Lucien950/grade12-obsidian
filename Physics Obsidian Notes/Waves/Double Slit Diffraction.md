![The two rays of light (red) meet at the first maximum away from the centre. Their path difference is \(\lambda\). It is important to remember that \(D >>d\), which means we can approximate both of the marked right angles to exactly \(90^\circ\) and say that the two angles marked \(\theta\) (green and blue) are equal.](https://kognity-prod.imgix.net/media/edusys_2/content_uploads/9.3.2.5.555411e645b4ce01162e.png?w=1611&h=735&auto=compress)
## Angle from the center

$$dsin(\theta)=n\lambda$$
where $\theta$ is the angle made betweeen the center and the $n$th maximum
$\lambda$ is the wavelength of the light
