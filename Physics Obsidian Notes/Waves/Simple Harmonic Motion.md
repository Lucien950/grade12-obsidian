# Simple Harmonic Motion
---
-   There is a **fixed cyclical path**.
-   There is a **central equilibrium point**.
	-   There is a **restoring force** directed toward the equilibrium point.
-   The motion repeats at **equal time periods**.
## Kinematics
- Calculated with [[Force]] and [[Displacement]]
$$a\propto-x$$
thus
$$F\propto -x$$
## Hooke's Law
$$F=-kx$$
where $k$ is the Hooke's constant for a given spring
## In regards to [[Period]]
for springs
$$T=2\pi\sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}$$
for pendulums
$$T=2\pi\sqrt{\frac{L}{g}}$$
## Energy
$$E_T=\frac12kx^2=\frac12mv^2=\frac12\omega^2x_0^2$$
## Kinematics
$$x=x_0sin(\omega t)$$
$$v=x_0\omega cos(\omega t)$$
$$a=x_0\omega^2sin(\omega t)$$
## Dampening
- Over damped
- Critically damped
- Under damped
