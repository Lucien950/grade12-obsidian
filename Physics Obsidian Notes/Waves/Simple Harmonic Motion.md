# Simple Harmonic Motion
---
-   There is a **fixed cyclical path**.
-   There is a **central equilibrium point**.
	-   There is a **restoring force** directed toward the equilibrium point.
-   The motion repeats at **equal time periods**.
## Kinematics
- Calculated with [[Force]] and [[Displacement]]
$$a\propto-x$$
thus
$$F\propto -x$$
## Hooke's Law
$$F=-kx$$
where $k$ is the Hooke's constant for a given spring
