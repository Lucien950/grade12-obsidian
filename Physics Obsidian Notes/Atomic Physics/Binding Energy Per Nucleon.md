# [[Binding Energy]] Per Nuclon
---
![[Pasted image 20220226164228.png]]
- Above is the graph of the binding energy per nucleon of a given element
- The higher it is, the more stable
- Binding energy = negative potential value.
	- HOLE ANALOGY
- If unstable, can cause [[Nuclear Decay]], right side does fission, left side does fusion
- Shows that $Fe-56$ is the most stable element
