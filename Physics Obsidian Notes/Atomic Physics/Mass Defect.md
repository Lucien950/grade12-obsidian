# Mass Defect $m_{def}$
---
- The mass of a given atom and the mass of all the protons/neutrons is not the same
- Some of the mass of the particles contribute to [[Binding Energy]]

## Carbon example
- carbon 12 has mass of $12u$
- nucleus should also have mass of
$$6\times1.007276u+6\times1.008665u=12.095646u$$
- electrons have some mass
$$12u-6\times0.000549u=11.996706u$$
