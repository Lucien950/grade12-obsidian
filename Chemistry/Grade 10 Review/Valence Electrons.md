# Valence Electrons
---
> the outside electrons of a given atom
- Very important when considering [[Grade 10 Review/Reactions]]
## Bonding Capacity
> The amount of free space around an atom
- Determined by the quantity of valence electrons
- Full valence shell = 8 electrons
- $8-valence=bondingCapacity$
