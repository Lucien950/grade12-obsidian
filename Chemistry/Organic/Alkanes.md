# Alkanes
---
- Carbons bonded together
- Hydrogens fill in missing space
## General Formula
$$C_nH_{2n+2}$$
## Naming
- Use [[Number Names]] to get the prefix
- Add "-ane" at the end
- E.x. 4 carbons = butane
## Branches
---
- Use the [[Number Names]] to name the subcomponent
- Subcomponent ends with "-yl"
- Get number, add name, prepend to alkane name
- IF APPEAR TWICE, both number location with comma seperation
	- USE STANDARD PREFIXES ON component name!!! (very weird and implied)
- IF MULTIPLE COMPONENTS, seperate with dash
- E.x. 2-methyl pentane
