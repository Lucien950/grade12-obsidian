<center>The representations of benzene -> all the atoms, line diagram (old), line diagram (new)</center>
## Delocalized Electrons
- The old ones thought that there were double and single bonds
- Double and single bonds have different bond lengths
- Therefore, these are not different bonds
- **electrons are shared between all the atoms**
	- C-H $sp_2$ hybridized
	- C orbitals $p_2$
	- Rest of them in $\pi$
