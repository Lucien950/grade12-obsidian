# Reduction [[Organic Reactions]]
---
- In oxidization, Alcohols -> Aldehydes/Ketones -> Carboxilic Acids
	- Reverse this for reduction
## [[Carboxilic Acids]] -> [[Alcohols]], Primary

- **Conditions**
	- Heat
	- $LiAlH_4$
	- [[Dry ether]]
- **CANNOT BE STOPPED AT ALDEHYDE**
	- To get back to aldehyde, oxidation is required
## Starting at [[Ketones + Aldehydes]] -> [[Alcohols]]

**- Just add reducing agentâ„¢**
- Reducting Agents: $LiAlH_4$ and $NaBH_4$
- They dissociate as follows: $Li^++AlH_4^-$ and $Na^++BH_4^-$
- Secondary -> 
	- Conditions: HEAT, $NaBH_4$
