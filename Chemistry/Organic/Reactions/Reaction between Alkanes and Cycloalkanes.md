# [[Organic Reactions]] with [[Alkanes]] and [[Cycloalkanes]]
---
- Alkanes very stable
	- C-C and C-H bonds very strong, non-polar
- Only reacts with $O_2$, $Cl_2$ and $Br_2$
## Oxygen
> Combustion üòÅ
$$C_8H_{18}+12.5O_2\rightarrow8CO_2+9H_2O$$
- Hydrocarbon combustion in fossil fuels
- Most organic compounds are combustible
### Complete and Incomplete Combustion
- Incomplete combutions also create $C_{(s)}$, $CO_{(g)}$
## Chlorine, Bromine
- IN **UV LIGHT**
- Uses [[Free Radical Substitution]] as mechanism
$$CH_4+Cl_2\rightarrow CH_3Cl+HCl$$
