# [[Organic Reactions]] of Unsaturated Hydrocarbons
---
- Break double bonds in [[Alkenes]] and replace with other molecules
## Adding $H_2$
> **Hydrogenation**
- $Pd$, $Pt$, $Ni$ used to speed up the reaction
	- Catalytic Hydrogentation
	- Needs PT Catalyst
	- Converts [[Alkenes]] to [[Alkanes]]

## Adding $Cl_2$ or $Br_2$
- No catalyst required
- $Br_2$ coloured, thus when reaction is finished, the product will be colourless

## Addition of Hydrogen Halides
- Similar rules
- Since acidic already, no more acid catalyst required
- Follows [[Markovnikov's Rule]]

## Addition of $H_2O$
- Makes [[Alcohols]]
- Uses Acid Catalyst
- Follow [[Markovnikov's Rule]]
