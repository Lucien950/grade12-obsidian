# Organic [[Reactions]]
## Key Terms
- Nucleophiles -> Base, Looking to get $H^+$ ions
- Electrophile -> Acid, looking to get rid of $H^+$ ions, get electrons
## General Reaction Types
### Redox
- Usually adding bits, such as Hydrogens or Oxygens (not full groups)
- [[Reduction]] and [[Oxidization Reactions w-Alcohols]]
### Substitution
- Replace whole groups
- [[Free Radical Substitution]]
