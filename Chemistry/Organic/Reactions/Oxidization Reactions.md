# Oxidization [[Organic Reactions]]
---
## Primary [[Alcohols]]
- Can look like adding $O$ or removing $H$
- Oxidaition requires C in alcohol to be attached to $OH$ and 2 $H$s
	- Thus, only primary alcohols can react
- Needs [[Distillation]] and [[Reflux]] 
- **REACTION CONDITION: has $KCrO_7$ or $KMnO_4$**
	- Changes the oxidation number of $Cr$ in both atoms
	- **Changes colour from yellow to green**
- Makes [[Ketones + Aldehydes]] (only aldehydes,linksðŸ˜¢) and [[Carboxilic Acids]]

## Secondary [[Alcohols]]
- Ketones are formed (rather than aldehydes)
	- This makes sense, because Hydroxide group is in the middle (for secondary alcohols)
- Does not go to acid, as not enough bonding locations
- Similar **REACTION CONDITIONS**

## Differentiation
- Boiling points/Melting points are different
- Primary might be more acidic (especially if to completion, and become caboxilic acid)
## Teriary Alcohol
- If reacting with tertiary alcohol, there is no change in colour, as no reaction
