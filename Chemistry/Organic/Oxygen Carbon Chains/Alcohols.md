- Hydration of [[Alkanes]]
- Oxidation reaction for other functional groups
# Alchols
---
$$R-OH$$
- Functional group: $OH$
	- **SPOT ONLY $O$** -> $H$ generally omitted, [[Oxygen Carbon Chains]]
- $OH$ is polar, thus making the alcohols polar
- There is hydrogen bonding, making this extra strong
- pH neutral (not actual base)
- Combustible
## Types of Alcohols
- Carbon to hydrogen to $OH$ ratio

## Naming
- Akyl + position number + "ol"
