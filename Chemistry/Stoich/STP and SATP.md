# STP and SATP
---
> STP: Standard Temperature & Pressure
> SATP: Standard Atomsphereic Temperature and Pressure

> Helps deal with **Volumes of [[Gasses]] in controlled environements**
- Avagadro's Hypothesis -> Equal volumes of gasses at the same temperature and pressure contain equal amount of substances
## STP
- $P=101.3 kPa$
- $T=0\degree C$
- molar volume of ideal gas $=22.7L/mol$
## SATP
- $P=100kPa$
- $25\degree C$
- molar volume of ideal gas $=24.9L/mol$
