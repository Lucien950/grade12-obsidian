# Gasses
---
## Properties
-   Gases fit a container uniformly
-   Lot of space between gas particles
-   Most time, gas particles have no intermolecular forces present
- Follows [[Collision Theory]]/Kinetic Model Theory
## Ideal Gasses
> Assume the following:
> 1- Gas **Particles has no Volume relative to spaces** between them
> 2- NO Intermolecular Forces
> 3- NO **Condensation under pressure**
> 4- Earlier **relations are perfectly linear**
> 5- Gas **volume at $0\degree K$ is 0**
### Ideal Gas Law
$$PV=8.31nT$$

## Unit Conversions
$$atm = 760mm Hg$$
$$atm = 101.325 kPa$$
