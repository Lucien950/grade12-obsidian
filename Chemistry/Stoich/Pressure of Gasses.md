# Pressure of [[Gasses]]
> Force per area exerted by gas
- Exerted due to **change in momentum** between gas particles and wall of container

## Partial Pressures
> “For a mixture of gases in a container, the total pressure exerted is the sum of the pressures that each gas would exert if it were alone” -Dalton
$$P_{total}=P_1+P_2+P_3+...$$
