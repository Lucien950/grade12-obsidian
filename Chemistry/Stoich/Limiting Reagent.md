# Limiting Reagent
---
> The substance which limits the amount of reaction that can occur
## Example
$$N_2+3H_2\rightarrow2NH_3$$
- Take result from [[Balanced Chemical Equations]]
- We have 6 mols of $N_2$ and 9 mols of $H_2$
- Here, the Nitrogen needs 18 mols of Hydrogen to react, thus it is limited to "Hydrogen's Molar Ratio".
- Only 3 mols of Nitrogen can be reacted
