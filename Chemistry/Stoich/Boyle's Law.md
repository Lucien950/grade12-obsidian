# Boyle's Law
---
- Mathematically calculate changes in [[Pressure of Gasses]] along with changes in **volume** in [[Gasses]]
$$\frac{P_1V_1}{T}=\frac{P_2V_2}{T}$$

- Makes sense, since more volume = less pressure, more space for particles to fly around in (kinetic model) $P \propto V^{-1}$
$$\frac{P_1}{P_2}=\frac{V_2}{V_1}$$
- Temperature also in proportionality constant, as temperature causes particles to fly around more = more pressure, $P\propto T$
$$\frac{P_1}{P_2}=\frac{T_1}{T_2}$$
- Combines to form Boyle's Law
## Charle's Law
> Extension on Boyle's law, except between volume and temperature
$$V\propto T$$
$$\frac{V_1}{V_2}=\frac{T_1}{T_2}$$
