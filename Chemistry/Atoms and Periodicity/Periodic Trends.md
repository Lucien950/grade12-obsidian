# Periodic Trends
---
## Atomic Radius
- High on left, low on right
- start low is new shell, more particles = more energy to attract
### Ionic Radius (Radius of Ions)
- **Cations** smaller because less shells
- **Anions** are larger because of electron repulsion

## Ionization Energy
> Depending on how much the element wants to get rid of the electron, it affects the Ionization energy

$Na^{1+}$ for example happens very easily
### First and Second ionization energy
First is quite low
Second is more, but not much more

## Electron Affinity
---
> The energy change associated with the addition of an electron
- Large negative value means that a lot of energy is released
- A large positive value means that a lot of energy is required
- Low on left, high on right
- low on bottom, high on top

## Electronegativity
---
> affects how the elements share the electron
> 0 - 0.2 Non-Polar Covalent 0.3 - 1.4 Polar Covalent 1.5+ Ionic
