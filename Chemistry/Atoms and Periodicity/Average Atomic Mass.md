- Atomic Number = Amount of Protons
- Mass Number = Amount of Neutrons + Protons
## Isotopes
> Same protons, different amounts of neutrons
- In a sample, there are usually different concentrations of different isotopes.
### Determining Mass with Mass Spectrometer

- Magnetic field applied, **difflects different isotopes different magnitude**
- As more neutrons do not contribute charge, more mass to charge = more neutrons = different isotopes
