## Bohr
- Confirms theories of [[Light and Quantum]]
- Light emits discrete energy
- Does this by emitting energy from electron orbital navigation
- Orbitals are **QUANTIZED (quantum)**
- **Math only works for Hydrogen (one electron, $Li^{2+}$)**

- The higher the orbital, the more dense the orbitals
- Exceed convergence point = ionized electron, electron leaves (work function physics)
