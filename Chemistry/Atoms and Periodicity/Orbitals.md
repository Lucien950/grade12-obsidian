## On Filling Electron Orbitals
- Aufbau
	- Fill lower energy first, the higher energy
- Pauli Exclusion Principle
	- Must have up and down
- Hundâ€™s Rule
	- Fill all the ups, then fill all the downs
### VERY HELPFUL

## Ion Rules
> REMOVE FROM THE HIGHER ORBITAL FIRST
- 4s before 3d even though its before in the order
## 3d4 and 3d9
> They don't exist
